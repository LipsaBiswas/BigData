CSV vs Parquet file format
===========================
Speed - Apache parquet is column-based file format whereas CSV is row-based file format. As parquet is a column-based file format , 
aggregation queries and skipping non-relevant data while querying is less time consuming compared to CSV which is row-based. 
Parquet is approx. 34X faster than CSV.

Storage -Parque supports many flexible compression options and efficient encoding schemes. Hence, parque takes much less storage compared to CSV.
Parquet takes almost 87% less storage than CSV.

Cost - Amazon Athena like service charge based on the amount of data scanned per query, Amazon charges according to the amount of data stored S3,
Google dataproc charges are time-based . Hence, based on the file size, data scanned per query, time taken to query, we are charged by service providers.
When using parquet cost involved is much less compared to CSV based on the storage-querytime-data scanned amount. 
While using Parquet , approx. 99% less data scanned

â›³ Overall saving : While using Parquet compared to CSV , overall cost saving is apprx. 99.7%
