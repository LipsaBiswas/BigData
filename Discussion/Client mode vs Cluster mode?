Client mode vs Cluster mode?
==================================
In Apache Spark, "client mode" and "cluster mode" refer to different deployment modes used for running Spark applications.

                          Client mode                               Cluster mode
                         ============                               ===============

Driver location    The Spark driver runs on the machine             The Spark driver runs within the cluster on one of the allocated worker nodes
===============    where the Spark application 
                   is submitted


Communication      The client machine communicates directly         The client machine submits the Spark application to the cluster manager,                                                              
=============      with the cluster's resource manager              (e.g., which launches the driver within the cluster. 
                   YARN, Mesos, or standalone) to request           The client machine is no longer involved in driver execution after submission.
                  resources and submit the Spark application.

Use case           Typically used for development, testing,          Used in production environments where the driver requires cluster resources. 
=======            and debugging.                                    It ensures better fault tolerance and scalability


Advantages        Easier for debugging and monitoring                Better suited for production environments with resource isolation and fault tolerance.
===========       Interactive development and testing                The driver is less vulnerable to client machine failures.
                  are simplified.
