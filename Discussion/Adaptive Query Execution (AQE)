AQE - Adaptive Query Execution
===============================
AQE is an important and advanced concept in Spark optimization tuning.
It is query re-optimization that occurs during query execution.

The motivation for runtime re-optimization is that Databricks has the most up-to-date accurate statistics at the end of a shuffle 
and broadcast exchange (referred to as a query stage in AQE).

Spark 1.x – Introduced Catalyst Optimizer and Tungsten Execution Engine
Spark 2.x – Added Cost-Based Optimizer 
Spark 3.0 – Now added Adaptive Query Execution

Syntax
======
spark.databricks.optimizer.adaptive.enabled
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled",true)

AQE features
=============
1. Dynamically coalescing shuffle partition
2. Dynamically switching join startegies
3. Dynamically optimizing skew joins
