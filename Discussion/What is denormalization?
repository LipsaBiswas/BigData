What is denormalization?
=============================

In data denormaliztion,  redundant columns are added to some dimension tables to make querying and working with the data faster and easier.
The purpose is to trade some redundancy (duplication of data) in the data model for increased query speed, by avoiding computationally expensive join operations.
