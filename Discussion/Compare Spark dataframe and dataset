Spark dataframe and dataset
=============================
Both DataFrames and Datasets are distributed collections of data with built-in optimizations for distributed processing.

DataFrames are more user-friendly and are suitable for users familiar with SQL and those who don't need the extra type safety provided by Datasets.

Datasets are recommended when strong typing and compile-time safety are essential, especially in applications like machine learning.

In summary, while DataFrames are widely used for simplicity and ease of use,
Datasets are preferred when stronger typing and performance optimizations are critical for specific use cases.
The choice between them depends on the requirements and complexity of your Spark application.
