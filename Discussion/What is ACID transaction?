What is ACID transaction?
=========================

Transactionan
------------
In the context of of databases and data storage systems, a transaction is any operation that is treated as a single unit of work,
which either completes fully or does not complete at all, and leaves the storage system in a consistent state.

ACID is an acronym that refers to the set of 4 key properties that define a transaction: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability

ACID transactions guarantee that each read, write, or modification of a table has Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability

ACID transactions ensure the highest possible data reliability and integrity. They ensure that your data never falls into an inconsistent 
state because of an operation that only partially completes
