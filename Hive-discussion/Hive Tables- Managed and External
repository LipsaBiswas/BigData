Hive Tables- Managed and External
====================================
There are tow types of tables in Hive:
1. Managed tables
2. External tables

Managed tables
===============
* By default, Hive creates managed or internal tables
* Hive manages both data and metadata of the managed table
* Dropping the table drops the metadata from metastore and the files from HDFS


External tables
================
* While creating table, using the optional keyword EXTERNAL , external tables are created
* Hive manages the table metadat but not the underlying files
* Dropping an external table drops just metadata from Metastore , does not delete data from HDFS
